Introduction
1. Quality Control
2. Quality check & Quality Assurance definition
3. Selecting required quality level
4. Types of quality checks - manual and automatic
5. Areas of quality checks - reliability, security, regression, maintainability

Manual:
manual testing of code style - code review
manual testing of code functionality

Levels of quality check maturity
0. No quality checks at all
1. Manual checks after release (by ourselves or dedicated QA tester / team)
2. Code review process (Pull Request model)
3. Locally executed unit tests & code style tests
4. CI server running & enforcing successful compilation / passing tests - no longer responsibility of reviewer
5. Faster feedback - pre-commit or on save hooks for code style
6. Automation of boring tasks - code autoformatters (prettier, black), extended checks (big files, secrets, merge conflicts)
7. Calculation of various code metrics - test coverage, Maintainability Index, Cyclomatic Complexity, Lines of Code etc
8. Dependency scanning & license management
9. Higher level tests (smoke, performance, security, E2E, acceptance etc)
